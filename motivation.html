<p>There was a fabulous worker,friend,and colleague everyone n her office ioved her from her bosses to the cleaning lady.she aiways had akind word for everyone.<br>one of her best assets was her amazing ability to help people feel good about themselves.she could  make someone whoose feeling had been huurt feel like they<br> were the best thing
since sliced bread.<strong><cite> could make an insecure colleague feel like a genius.</cite></strong>her sense of behaviour and humor always lifted others moods and<br> made them laugh even if they w ere annoyed or unhappy.but she was smart-very smart .in her five years on the job,she had received three promotions,and her em-<br>ployer had recently told her that she was on a fast track towards a management position.if things continued the way
they were going,<mark>she could even cxpect a vice-<br>presidency within just a few years.</mark>
<blockquote>
one evening while working late on a project,<ins style="color: black;"> she discovered that her boss</ins> had made a bad judgement call in a speech that he had written and asked her to edit it.<br>he had included a foolish joke that some could find offensive. there as she picked the phone to leave him a voice mail and tell him her thought.<q>what were you<br> thinking goss?</q>
she said.don't you know the <abbr title=cheif executive officer>CEO</abbr> will hate the joke?she said.and he has no sense of humor.<del> dondn dfemgdm.</del>
</blockquote>
</p>


<p>
    unfortunately,<small> of sending the voice mail to her boss,</small>therese inadvertently pressed a button that sent the voice mail everyone in the company.the next morning<br> chaos ensured,while therese wasn't fired,she didn't get that next promotion or the one after the push of a button has sealed her future in the company.

<h2>words...</h2>
<hr>
<pre>
I am sure you have heard someone say,<q>you are going to eat those words.</q>it may sound like a mere statement to us,but in reality<br> 
we do eat our words what we say not only affect us.words are wonderful when used in a proper way.they can encourage,edify,and
<br> give confidence to the hearer.A right word spoken at the right time can actually be life changing.
<blockquote>
    a man has joy in making an apt answer,<br>
    and a word spoken at the right moment<br>
    how good it is!  <i>PROVERB 15:23</i>
</blockquote>
<pre>
we can literally increase our own joy by speakking right words. we can also upset ourselves by talking unnecessary about our
<br> problem or things that have hurt us in relationship.not too long ago i had a disappointing situation take place with someone
<br> i considered to be a close friend and i noticed that,eachtime i talk about it i will have a difficult time getting it off my
<br> head for the remainder of the day.i finally realised that if i was to get it off i had to stop mentally and verbally going
<br> over it again and again.

<h3>SEEDTIME AND HARVEST</h3>
<hr>
<p>
<address style="text-align: center;">
in the bible we learn the principle os sowing and reaping<br>
beginning in genesis,god teaches us that as long as the <br>
earth remains,there will be seedtime and harvest.we can<br>
readily understand how a farmer sows seed and waits for his<br>
harvest,but we need more understtanding to what i refer to<br>
<q>spiritual seed</q>
